GPUs have thousands of cores that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, making them much faster at performing matrix operations and other computations required for training machine learning models. This parallel processing power allows GPUs to significantly reduce the time it takes to train models compared to CPUs, which have fewer cores and are better suited for sequential processing tasks. Additionally, GPUs are optimized for handling large amounts of data and complex mathematical calculations, making them ideal for training deep learning models that require intensive computations. Overall, the GPU's ability to handle parallel processing makes it a more efficient and effective choice for training models compared to the CPU.\""

Create a new Ruby file (e.g. `mailgun_api.rb`) and require the `mailgun-ruby` gem at the top of the file.\\n\\n4. Initialize the Mailgun client with your API key and domain name:\\n\\n```ruby\\nrequire 'mailgun-ruby'\\n\\nmailgun = Mailgun::Client.new(api_key: 'YOUR_API_KEY', domain: 'YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME')\\n```\\n\\n5. Now you can start using the Mailgun API to send emails, manage mailing lists, and more. Here's an example of sending an email using the Mailgun API:\\n\\n```ruby\\nmailgun.messages.send_email(\\n  from: 'you@example.com',\\n  to: 'recipient@example.com',\\n  subject: 'Hello from Mailgun',\\n  text: 'This is a test email sent using the Mailgun API'\\n)\\n```\\n\\n6. You can also use the Mailgun API to track email deliveries, bounces, and spam complaints. Check the Mailgun documentation for more information on available endpoints and parameters.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can easily develop an API to Mailgun using Ruby and start integrating Mailgun's powerful email services into your applications.\""
